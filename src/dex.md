# DEX

> This chapter is currently under heavy development

This chapter contains notes about decentralized exchange protocols (DEX). The
main purpose of such protocols is to provide blockchain users a way to exchange
one type of ERC20 tokens for another. The exchange rate, fees, and the way how
exactly the exchange take place usually completely dictated by the protocol's
internals. Hereafter the process of token exchange would be referred as a **swap**.

By the moment this document is being written multiple families of DEX protocols
exists:
